## What you can do today

Full status, verification and known gaps: [docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md).

## Self-host

SaaSassin {{productName}} is a Next.js app backed by Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore.
You need Node.js 20.9 or newer, [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) and a Firebase project of
your own.

### 1. Create a Firebase project

1. Create a project in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. **Firestore:** Build → Firestore Database → Create database.
3. **Authentication:** Build → Authentication → Get started. {{productName}} signs people in with
   **Google** and **Email/Password**; step 2 below enables both, or enable them yourself under
   Authentication → Sign-in method.
4. **Web app config:** Project settings → General → Your apps → add a Web app. Copy its config
   into the `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` variables.
5. **Service account:** Project settings → Service accounts → Generate new private key. From the
   downloaded JSON, set `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` (`project_id`), `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`
   (`client_email`) and `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` (`private_key`). Never commit the key, and never
   give these variables a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.
6. Once you deploy, add your domain under Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains
   (`localhost` is already allowed).

### 2. Deploy the rules, indexes and sign-in providers

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm exec firebase login
pnpm exec firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes,auth --project <your-project-id>
```

{{rulesSummary}} `auth` enables the Google and email/password providers listed in `firebase.json`.

### 3. Run it

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in the values from step 1
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). This repository serves SaaSassin
{{productName}} at the root of every host: `next.config.ts` sets `STANDALONE_PRODUCT={{slug}}`,
and `src/proxy.ts` maps `/` to the product (`{{appRoot}}`) and `/sign-in` to its sign-in page.

### 4. Deploy to Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)]({{deployUrl}})

The button copies this repository into your GitHub account, creates a Vercel project and asks for
the Firebase variables. To deploy an existing fork instead, import it in Vercel and add the
variables from `.env.example` under Project Settings → Environment Variables. Either way, add the
Vercel domain to your Firebase authorized domains afterwards.

## Tests

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test        # unit tests
pnpm build
```

The Firestore suites run against the local Firestore emulator, which needs a Java 21+ JDK first on
your `PATH`:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk-21   # macOS example: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-21.jdk/Contents/Home
export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
pnpm test:rules      # Firestore security rules
{{emulatorCommand}}
```
